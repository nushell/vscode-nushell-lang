# Convention for snippets

## Naming

Naming convention for `description`:

- for operators it's `"<operator>" operator` (e.g. `"in" operator`)
- for functions it's `function definition` or `"<function>" function definition`
- for builtins it's `"<builtin>" invocation` (e.g. `"alias" invocation"`) or
  `"<builtin> <subcommand>" invocation` (e.g. `"bits or" invocation"`)
- for shell shebang it's `shebang`
- for anything else it's any string

Naming convention for `prefix`:

- for operators it's `<operator>` (e.g. `in`)
- for functions it's `function`, `<function>` (e.g. `main`)
- for builtins it's `<builtin>` (e.g. `alias`) or `<builtin>-<subcommand>`
  (e.g. `bits-or`)
- for shebang it's `shebang`
- for anything else it's any string

If snippet contains a documenting comment than prefix should begin with at `@`
symbol.

Snippets are only created for commands those satisfy at least one condition:

- read data from stdin
- have at least one mandatory or optional argument (not `...rest`)
  Here by argument positional argument or argument for an option is meant.

If there are options available for command or a subcommand then there is no
restriction about what options to pick to put in snippet definition.

Always prefer pipes over direct argument passing.

## Placeholders

Placeholders by default should describe what kind of value is expected like
`${1:path/to/directory}`. But when there is a format defined for placeholder
then example value should be used like `${1:ff}`.

Placeholders can not to list all available choices like
`${1|big5,euc-jp,euc-kr,gbk,iso-8859-1,utf-16,cp1252,latin5|}`. When there are
more then 8 alternatives, provide the most common ones in terms of usage
frequency (it doesn't apply for `date` snippet, data
types, durations and subcommands).

## Grouping

Always group snippets presenting different subcommands for the same command and
sharing the same set of options via placeholders with alternatives when there
is no snippet for this command without subcommands. Write this:

```json
{
  "hash builtin": {
    "prefix": "hash",
    "description": "\"hash\" invocation",
    "body": "${1:command} | hash ${2|md5,sha256|}"
  }
}
```

instead of:

```json
{
  "hash md5 builtin": {
    "prefix": "hash-md5",
    "description": "\"hash md5\" invocation",
    "body": "${1:command} | hash md5"
  },
  "hash sha256 builtin": {
    "prefix": "hash-sha256",
    "description": "\"hash sha256\" invocation",
    "body": "${1:command} | hash sha256"
  }
}
```
